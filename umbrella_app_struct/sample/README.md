# Sample

Demonstrates the umbrella application structure wherein a single project entails  sub applications which are too small  to make a single full blown application,but large enough at the same time to exist as a single module.

They can be tested and run individually by going into the respective project folders -

`cd ../apps/app_name` 

For testing the application:

Place `queries.txt` of the form. 

```
x1 x2
y1 y2
z1 z2
``` 

and run-

`bash script/mul.sh`

For detailed debug options,see the file `script/mul.sh` for more details.
